### ðŸ‘‹ Hey there!

- I'm Vinn, a backend engineer who enjoys building cool stuff with cloud-native tools.
- Iâ€™m into distributed systems, observability, cloud orchestration and automations making DevOps a little less painful.
- Iâ€™ve contributed to:
  - OpenTelemetry Collector
     - [Add context handling to sinks in consumertest](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/pull/13048)
     - [Added type check before processing for sum metrics](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/pull/13780)
  - OpenTelemetry Operator

  - Grafana Operator
      - [Added watchers for cm, secrets in datasource_controller](https://github.com/grafana/grafana-operator/pull/2178)
- Currently tinkering with AI agents, model context protocols, and automating developer workflows on cloud. I have recently ventured into frontend technologies too - check out my new portfolio site here: https://vinn-portfolio-pi.vercel.app/
