### 👋 Hey there!

- 🧑‍💻 I'm Vinn — a backend engineer who enjoys building cool stuff with cloud-native tools.
- 🚀 I’m into distributed systems, observability, and making DevOps a little less painful.
- 🛠️ I’ve contributed to:
  - [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/pull/13048)
  - [OpenTelemetry Operator](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-operator/pull/4041)
- 🔍 Obsessed with observability, distributed computing and cloud orchestration and automations.
- 🌐 Currently tinkering with AI agents, model context protocols, and automating contributor workflows. I have recently ventured into frontend technologies too - check out my new portfolio site here: https://vinn-portfolio-pi.vercel.app/
